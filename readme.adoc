= Notes for Ansible on Raspberry Pi

This is a simple Ansible setup to do basic tasks on a Raspberry Pi. I'm using Raspberry Pi 4.

== Ping
`ansible-playbook -k ping.yml`

== Reboot
`ansible-playbook -k reboot.yml`

== Shutdown
`ansible-playbook -k shutdown.yml`

== Update
`ansible-playbook -k update.yml`

== Upgrade
`ansible-playbook -k upgrade.yml`

== Info
`ansible-playbook -k info.yml`

=== Troubleshooting
If you get any Ansible errors, add `-vvvv` to the command to increase verbosity. This will help a lot!
